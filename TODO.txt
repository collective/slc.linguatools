* Find and use an object-picker widget for "Cut & Paste" - having to type the
  destination path is ugly.

* Distinguish between global functions (e.g. Set title) and those that only
  make sense on a folder (e.g. Delete).

* Add a function for setting a (marker) interface on all translations, such as
  INavigationRoot.
