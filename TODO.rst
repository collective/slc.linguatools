* Find and use an object-picker widget for "Cut & Paste" - having to type the
  destination path is ugly.

* Distinguish between global functions (e.g. Set title) and those that only
  make sense on a folder (e.g. Delete).

* Add a configuration page in the control panel so that the manager can select
  the available functions (e.g. exclude the Marker Interface function)
